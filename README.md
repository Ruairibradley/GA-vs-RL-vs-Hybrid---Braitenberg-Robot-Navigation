# GA-vs-RL-vs-Hybrid---Braitenberg-Robot-Navigation
The comparative study of Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and Hybrid models for Braitenberg robots learning in learning autonomous light seeking behaviour.

This project explores and compares the performance of Genetic Algorithms (GA), Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning), and a Hybrid GA+QL approach for training *Braitenberg vehicles* to autonomously seek light.  
It was developed as part of the *Acquired Intelligence and Adaptive Behaviour* module at the University of Sussex (2025).

## Overview

Braitenberg vehicles are simple sensor-based robots that exhibit intelligent behaviour from basic rules, they have two light sensors connected to two motors powering the wheels.  
This project investigates how different learning paradigms - evolutionary vs reinforcement-based - influence the robotâ€™s ability to adapt to dynamic environments.
All models were developed offline in simulation to find weightings for the motors and then transfered onto the real robot for analysis on performance, and also to highlight sim to real limitations. 

Three models were implemented:
- Genetic Algorithm (GA): Evolves controller weights over generations based on performance (fitness) in the environment.  
- Q-Learning (RL): Learns optimal actions via trial-and-error and reward feedback.  
- Hybrid GA+QL: Combines GA evolution for initialisation with Q-Learning fine-tuning to balance exploration and exploitation.
